\title{Micrometeoroid Events in LISA Pathfinder}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.1 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.1 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.1 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.1 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that

\begin{abstract}

LISA Pathfinder was a technology demonstration mission for future space-based gravitational wave observatories which launched on December 3rd, 2015 and conducted science operations near Earth-Sun L1 until July of 2017 when it was deliberately decommissioned after a successful mission. Pathfinder's principal objective was to demonstrate a technique known as drag-free flight in which the spacecraft was controlled to fly around a pair of freely-flying reference masses located within one of its instruments. To achieve drag-free flight, the control system had to reject external disturbances on the spacecraft using a one of two micropropulsion systems. One such disturbance was impacts of micrometeoroids, which left a unique signature in the control system data. Using a simple model of the impacts, this signature can also be used to measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related to the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for impacts during a large fraction of the Pathfinder data. We report a total of XXX candidates with momenta ranging from XXX to XXX.  We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates with models of two distinct  micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system, those resulting from Jupiter-family comets and those resulting from Hailey-type comets. 
\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% See the online documentation for the full list of available subject
%% keywords and the rules for their use.
\keywords{dust, micrometeoroids --- 
miscellaneous}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. 

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivate problem of dust population. What do we know and how? What don't we know? Why is it important?
    \item Introduce LPF. What is it? Basic idea of how we do micrometeoroid science
    \item Describe organization of the remainder of paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Population Models}\label{sec:models}
Description of Models that we are looking at.  How are they motivated?  What are the differences between them. Describe their basic predictions for LPF orbit (rate, momentum distribution, and Sky Position). We should draft this and then get Petr/Diego to take a look at it and modify. See Figure \ref{fig:models}.

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}
Overall intro of the three steps
\subsection{Calibration of LPF data}\label{sec:calibration}
Description of how LPF uses a control loop and we "unfold" the loop to get the equivalent free-body reaction.  Also describe the rotating-frame effects and requirements for calibraiton of actuators, S/C mass properties, etc. Reference LPF papers.

Also describe the basic noises and expected SNR.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Detection, Parameter Estimation, and Vetos}\label{sec:MCMC}
Describe impact model in 3-D and frequency domain. Describe the MCMC tool and what tests we did on it. 


\FloatBarrier
\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

Describe how many segments we looked at, how they were separated between LTP,DRS, etc. How we did cuts, how many initial candidates we had, and how many were left after vetos of different types. Summary of the catalog in Figure \ref{fig:timeline}  and Table \ref{tab:candidates}.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Micrometeoroids are important and we want to know more
\item We used an entirely novel method to sample the micrometeoroid population at L1
\item We are consistent (or not) with models and we have some idea as to why (or why not)
\item Some rough statements about what this means for LISA  and also other missions (telescopes)

%% the manusscript. Authors should list each code and include either a
%% citation or url to the code inside ()s when available.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc. The
%% Figure and Table counter will not reset

%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% \aastex provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.

\bibliography{Bibliography2}

%% This command is needed to show the entire author+affilation list when
%% the collaboration and author truncation commands are used.  It has to
%% go at the end of the manuscript.
%\allauthors

%% Include this line if you are using the \added, \replaced, \deleted
%% commands to see a summary list of all changes at the end of the article.
