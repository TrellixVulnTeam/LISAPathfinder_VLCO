\title{Micrometeoroid Events in LISA Pathfinder}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.1 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.1 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.1 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\begin{abstract}

LISA Pathfinder was a technology demonstration mission for future space-based gravitational wave observatories which launched on December 3rd, 2015 and conducted science operations near Earth-Sun L1 until July of 2017 when it was deliberately decommissioned after a successful mission. Pathfinder's principal objective was to demonstrate a technique known as drag-free flight in which the spacecraft was controlled to fly around a pair of freely-flying reference masses located within one of its instruments. To achieve drag-free flight, the control system had to reject external disturbances on the spacecraft using a one of two micropropulsion systems. One such disturbance was impacts of micrometeoroids, which left a unique signature in the control system data. Using a simple model of the impacts, this signature can also be used to measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related to the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for impacts during a large fraction of the Pathfinder data. We report a total of XXX candidates with momenta ranging from XXX to XXX.  We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates with models of two distinct  micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system, those resulting from Jupiter-family comets and those resulting from Hailey-type comets. \red{CONCLUSION OF MODEL RESULTS GOES HERE}

%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Introduction. Briefly introduce micrometeoroid/dust science, LISA Pathfinder mission, basic physics of the detection \cite{Thorpe:2015cxa}

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

Detection / characterization methods.  Briefly descirbe steps for the detection and the detection steps. Reference Tyson's paper.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

Using the techniques described in Section \ref{sec:methods}, we performed a systematic search for impact events in a total of XXX hours of data during the interval from XXX to XXX. The searched time intervals covered only those times when the spacecraft was in a drag-free operational mode and no signal injections were being deliberately introduced. This included XXX hours of operations with the Cold Gas Micropropulsion system, XXX hours with the colloidal micropropulsion system, and XXX with both systems operating. The total `duty cycle' for micrometeoroid detection is thus XXX. Figure \ref{fig:timeline} depicts the searched intervals (blue bars) along with the impact candidates (dots). A total of XXX impact candidates were identified, the estimated impact time, SNR, transferred momentum, direction, and impact location are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:candidates} in Appendix \ref{sec:catalog}.

The bottom panel shows the cumulative time searched (quiescent noise runs) as a function of Day of Mission (DOM) for the three mission configurations: LTP (blue), DRS (red), joint operations (green), as well as the total (black). The top panel shows candidate micrometeoroid events as a function of time along with their  estimated transferred momentum and 90\% confidence interval error bars. The grey segments indicate log gaps in the search mostly due to other operations on the spacecraft (signal injections, etc.). The dashed vertical lines indicate calendar dates for the beginning of each quarter. \label{fig:timeline}}
