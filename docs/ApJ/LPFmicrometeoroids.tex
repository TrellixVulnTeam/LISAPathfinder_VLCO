\title{Micrometeoroid Events in LISA Pathfinder}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.1 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.1 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.1 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\begin{abstract}
The zodiacal dust complex, a population of dust and small particles that pervades the Solar System, provides important insight into the formation and dynamics of planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies.  Efforts to understand this system have relied on analytic and numerical models anchored by observational data.  Much of this observational data is concentrated in the near-Earth regime, where the planet's gravitational effects mask some of the subtle but important differences between different models. Here we present a new set of data obtained using a novel technique: direct measurements of momentum transfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is made possible by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft, a technology demonstrator for a future space-based gravitational wave observatory that operated near the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point from early 2016 through Summer of 2017. Pathfinder employed a technique known as drag-free control whereby the spacecraft was commanded to maintain a constant position and attitude relative to a free-flying test mass within the instrument. This required rejection of external disturbances, including particle impacts, using a micropropulsion system. Using a simple model of the impacts and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to detect impacts and measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related to the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for impacts during \nhours hours of Pathfinder data. We report a total of \nhits candidates with momenta ranging from 0.2$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$ to 230$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$.  We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates with models of micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system, those resulting from Jupiter-family comets, Oort-cloud comets, and Hailey-type comets. We find weak evidence suggesting that our observed population is most consistent with the properties of the Hailey-type comets although the statistics with this limited data set are modest.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Our Solar System hosts a population of dust and small particles that originate as debris from asteroids, comets, and other bodies.  Understanding these particles is important both for gaining insight into the formation of our Sun and its planets as well as for the dust population around other stars. More practically, dust and micrometeoroids are a critical component of the environment in which our spacecraft operate and against whose hazards they must be designed.  Like many fields in astrophysics, the behavior of the Solar System dust complex has been addressed from both theoretical and observational perspectives. Theorists have developed models of the production of dust from comets and asteroids,  its evolution under the effects of gravity and the solar environment, and its destruction through accretion and other processes. Observationally, this population has been constrained through measurements of its interaction with Earth's atmosphere (photographic, visual, and radio meteors, e.g. \cite{Halliday1984, Hawkes2007, Trigo-Rodriguez2008}), observations of zodiacal light (e.g.,  \cite{Krick2012, Durmont1980}), analysis of microcraters in Apollo lunar samples (e.g.  \cite{Allison1982}), and in-situ measurements made with ionization and penetration detectors on spacecraft (e.g.,  \cite{Weiden1978, Zhang1995}).  These theoretical and observational models are broadly consistent with one another, although important questions remain. One issue is that the bulk of the observational data is from the environment near Earth, a region in which some of the more subtle differences in the models of the underlying population are masked by the influence of the planet itself. Data taken far from Earth could in principle be used to distinguish such subtleties.
\\
LISA Pathfinder (LPF), A European Space Agency (ESA) mission which operated near the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L1) from January 2016 through July of 2017, is in an ideal orbit to make such measurements. However, LPF flew no instrumentation dedicated to micrometeoroid or dust detection.  LPF's primary objective was to demonstrate technologies for a future space-based observatory of milliHertz-band gravitational waves. The key achievement of LPF was placing two gold-platinum cubes known as `test masses' into a free-fall so pure it was characterized by accelerations at the femto-g level (e.g., \cite{LPF_PRL_2016, LPF_PRL_2018}), the level required to detect the minute disturbances caused by passing gravitational waves. In order to reach this level of performance, the test masses were released into cavities inside the spacecraft and a control system was employed to keep the spacecraft centered on the test masses.  This control system was designed to counteract disturbances on the spacecraft, including those caused by impacts from micrometeoroids. Shortly before LPF's launch, it was realized that data from the control system, if properly calibrated, could be used to detect and characterize these impacts and infer information about the impacting particles (e.g., \cite{Thorpe:2015cxa}). Early results from the first few months of LPF operations suggested that such events could indeed be identified and were roughly consistent with the pre-launch predictions of their effect on the control system (e.g., \cite{Thorpe2017a}). In this paper we present results from the first systematic search for micrometeoroid impacts in the LPF data set.  Our data set consists of \nhours hours of data in both the nominal LPF configuration as well as the "Disturbance Reduction System" (DRS) configuration, in which a NASA-supplied controller and thruster system took over control of the spacecraft. This data set corresponds to the times when LPF was operating in a `quiet' mode, without any intentional signal injections or other disturbances. During this period, we have identified \nhits impact candidates using our detection pipeline and manual vetoing. We characterized the properties of this data set and compared it to several theoretical models for the underlying dust population. 
\\
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:models} we summarize the dust population models to which we compare our data set and their relevant properties. In Section \ref{sec:methods} we describe our detection technique, including initial calibration, search, parameter estimation, and vetoing. Section \ref{sec:results} summarizes our results, including examples of individual events, properties of the observed population, and statistical comparisons with the theoretical models. Conclusions from this work and implications for future work are contained in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}. A complete list of the impact candidates is included in Appendix A.

\section{Population Models}\label{sec:models}

In this work we utilized dynamical models of meteoroids in the Solar System to characterize the direction, velocity and mass of particles impacting the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft.
The meteoroids considered here originate from three cometary sources: short period Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) and long period Halley Type and Oort Cloud Comets (HTCs and OCCs, respectively). JFCs are modeled following the work  reported by~\cite{Nesvorny10,Nesvorny11a}, who estimated that these particles represent 85 $-$ 95\% of the total meteoroid budget (in terms of number of particles) in the inner solar system. The assumed JFCs initial distribution of orbital elements followed the one proposed by~\cite{LevisonDuncan97}, where the number of comets as a function of their distance from perihelion, q, is given by

\begin{equation}
dN(q)\propto q^{\gamma_\mathrm{JFC}} dq\label{nq}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\gamma_\mathrm{JFC}$ is a free parameter ($\gamma_\mathrm{JFC} = 0$ in this work). The continuous Size Frequency Distribution (SFD) of meteoroids produced by these comets is given by a broken power-law

\begin{equation}
dN(D)\propto D^{-\alpha}dD\label{nd}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $D$ is the meteoroid diameter and $\alpha=3$ the slope index. Once released from the comets, JFC meteoroids drift towards the inner solar system under the influence of Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag and provide a continuous input of extra terrestrial material to Earth from the direction of the H and AH apparent sporadic sources~\cite[][]{JonesBrown93,Nesvorny10}.

To describe the contribution of long period HTCs we utilized the steady-state model by~\cite{Pokorny14}, who used it to explain the origin of the Toroidal meteoroid sources~\cite[][]{JonesBrown93,CampbellBrown09,Janches15}, characterized by high-ecliptic latitude radiants ($\beta\sim\pm 55^{\circ} - 60^{\circ}$), both located north and south from the apex direction. These meteoroids impact the Earth with a typical velocity of $\sim$35 km~s$^{-1}$, resulting in high-inclination pre-atmospheric orbits with respect to the ecliptic ($\sim70^{\circ}$). In addition, their semimajor axes are close to 1 AU, but with a long tail to larger values, and have a broad distribution of eccentricities with a maximum at $\sim$0.2~\cite[See Figure 13 in][]{Janches15}. 

Once again, these model tracks the dynamical evolution of thousands of dust particles released from a synthetic population of HTCs for millions of years until particles reach the end of their life, either by being scattered from the solar system by giant planets (mostly Jupiter), or by encountering one of the terrestrial planets, or by evolving too close to the Sun. The model adopts the HTC orbital architecture proposed by~\cite{Levison06} based on an observed inclination distribution of HTCs, which contains preferentially prograde orbits with a median inclination value of $\sim$55$^{\circ}$ and only a small fraction of comets on retrograde orbits. The prograde portion of HTC populate mostly the Toroidal sources with a characteristic velocity distribution which peaks at $\sim$25 km~s$^{-1}$. The model shows also that the Ap source is formed in part also by HTC-released particles, with a velocity distribution which peaks at $\sim$55 km~s$^{-1}$. These are predominantly retrograde or high eccentricity orbits representing a minority ($\sim$11\%) of cases among the HTCs, yet, together with OCCs, probably dominate impact ejecta production at the Moon.

For meteoroids released from OCCs, we adapted the model developed by~\cite{Nesvorny11b}, who investigated the effects of radiation pressure on particles released from the highly eccentric OCC orbits, and their dynamical evolution under gravitational perturbations from planets and P-R drag to determine if at least a fraction of the near-Earth meteoroid environment is produced by the contribution of dust released from these bodies. 
For small perihelion distances $q$, the model follows the orbital distribution reported by~\cite{Francis05}. For larger perihelion distances, the authors assumed an increasing distribution with $q$, as oppose to the flat and/or declining distribution proposed by~\cite{Francis05}, given by

\begin{equation}
dN(q)\propto
\begin{cases}
(1+\sqrt q)dq & \text{if}\ q<2 \mathrm{AU}\\
2.41(q)^{\gamma_\mathrm{OCC}} dq & \text{if}\ q> 2 \mathrm{AU}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where 0$\leq\gamma_\mathrm{OCC}\leq$1 and $q$ is uniformly distributed between 0 AU$\leq q\leq$ 5 AU, thus assuming that particles with $q>$ 5 AU will never reach Earth. In this work, we use $\gamma_\mathrm{OCC}= 0$ since the authors found that the effect of changing this parameter was insignificant.  

\cite{Nesvorny11b} found that OCC particles cannot provide a significant contribution to the overall meteoroid-budget of the inner zodiacal cloud. Most of the small particles (i.e. $D\sim$10 $\mu$m) are blown out of the solar system by radiation pressure, while millimeter sized meteoroids get scattered by planets and their orbits never decouple from Jupiter and thus the collision probability of these meteoroids with Earth is negligible. 
The authors concluded that only meteoroids with diameters between $\sim$100--300 $\mu$m can evolve in orbits decoupled from Jupiter and effectively populate the Ap source with preferentially retrograde meteors observed impacting the Earth with speeds around $55-60$ km~s$^{-1}$.

Collectively these models have been utilized to model various meteoroids related phenomena at Earth~\cite[][]{CarrilloSanchez16, Janches17}, at the Moon~\cite{Janches18} and at Mercury~\cite{Pokorny17,Pokorny18}

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}
The process of extracting micrometeoroid impact events from the LPF data stream can be divided into three distinct steps: calibration to equivalent free-body acceleration, detection and parameter estimation, and post-processing.  The following three subsections describe these three steps in more detail, the end result of which is a catalog of impact candidates.


\subsection{Calibration of LPF data}\label{sec:calibration}
As mentioned in the introduction, LPF uses a sophisticated control system to maintain the positions and attitudes of the spacecraft (S/C) and the two test masses (TMs) such that a number of constraints are satisfied.  Example constraints include maintaining the positions and orientations of the TMs at constant values relative to the S/C and maintaining the S/C attitude relative to the Sun and Earth. In total, the control system takes measurements of 15 kinematic degrees of freedom (DoFs), 3 positions + 3 attitudes for both test masses and 3 attitudes for the spacecraft, and generates actuation commands for 18 DoFs, 3 forces and 3 torques for the two test masses and the spacecraft.  Positions and angles are measured using a star tracker, a capacitive sensing system, and an optical interferometric sensing system. An electrostatic actuation system applies forces and torques to each TM and a micropropulsion system applies forces and torques to the S/C. 

\begin{figure}

\caption{Example of x-axis telemetry for impact candidate at GPS time XXX and the equivalent free-body acceleration estimated through the calibration procedure.\label{fig:models} \red{This is stolen from our LISA11 proceedings. We need to make a new version, maybe try the impact that we used for the first example of the MCMC results.}}
\end{figure}

One effect of the control system is to split the effect of a micrometeoroid impact into both the measured position and commanded force signals, both of which are telemetered down to ground. Figure \ref{fig:models}(a) shows an example of this for an impact candidate observed on 2016-05-16.  The top panel shows the measured position of one TM relative to the S/C along the x-axis, as measured using the optical interferometer.  For the first $\sim50\,$s, the signal exhibits random fluctuations with an RMS amplitude of a few nanometers. Just after 50$\,$s, the signal shows a steep upwards ramp, reaching more than $50\,$nm in a few seconds.  The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:models}(a) shows the force commands on the S/C in the x-direction, which are used to maintain the TM-S/C distance in this control mode. Shortly after the observed ramp in the motion, the controller commands a thrust of a few $\mu$N in the +x direction to compensate this motion.  The resulting acceleration of the S/C causes the TM-S/C separation to stop increasing, turn around, a return towards zero. In response, the controller reduces the applied force on the S/C. After two oscillations and roughly a minute, the system is back in its quiescent state.  By combining the force telemetry and the position telemetry with appropriate constants such as the calibration of the force actuators and the mass of the S/C, the equivalent free-body acceleration can be constructed. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:models}(b) and exhibits the classic impulse response in acceleration that is expected for an impact. For this particular signal, which is one of the larger momentum impacts in our data set, a small overshoot in our reconstructed free-body acceleration can also be seen. This is likely to be due to errors in calibration factors or the relative timing of the various telemetries rather than an feature of the impact event itself, which occurs on timescales far shorter than the $0.1\,$s cadence of the telemetry. 

The basic process illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:models} can be repeated along the other DoFs of the S/C in order to develop a data set of the equivalent free-body acceleration of the S/C in all six DoFs. In doing so, a number of considerations must be addressed. First, the fact that the TMs are not located at the center of mass of the S/C means that torques applied to the S/C lead to accelerations in the linear DoFs of the S/C.  Secondly, the `topology' of the control system, or which actuations are used to control which displacements, is different for each DoF and also for the various operational modes of the control system. Lastly, generating the free-body accelerations requires knowledge of a number of calibration factors such as S/C and TM mass properties, location of the TMs in the S/C frame, locations of the thrusters on the spacecraft and their orientations, calibration and cross-talk in both sensors and actuators, and relative timing/phase information between the various telemetry.  Some of these effects and calibration factors were measured in-flight during dedicated experiments designed to calibrate the LPF hardware for its primary mission. Examples include calibration of the x-axis electrostatic TM actuation (e.g. \red{cal. paper}) and calibration of the thruster response (e.g. \red{ST7 paper, maybe Cold Gas paper}). For quantities that were not measured in flight, our models were built using the nominal values provided by the equipment manufacturers. 
\\
The end result of this calibration step was a set of twelve timeseries corresponding to the equivalent free-body acceleration of the S/C in each of 6 DoFs as measured by each of the two TMs. We denote these as $g_{1i}(t)$ and $g_{2i}(t)$ where $i=\left(x,\,y,\,z,\,\theta,\eta,\,\phi\right)$ for TM1 and TM2 respectively. The S/C coordinates are defined such that $z$ is the direction of the top deck (oriented at the Sun), $x$ is the direction along the two test masses with +x pointing from TM1 towards TM2, and $y$ completes a right-handed triad. The angles $\theta,\,\eta,\,\phi$ represent right-hand rotations around $x,\,y,\,z$ respectively.

\subsection{Impact Model and Sensitivity}
\label{sec:sensitivity}
The characteristic timescales of the impact process are short relative the sample cadence of the LPF data (typically $0.1\,\textrm{s}$). Consequently, we model the impact as a delta-function impulse in acceleration for each DoF.  These impulses occur at the same time for each DoF but have different amplitudes which encode information about the impact direction and location on the spacecraft. The modeling of the impact is performed in two steps. First, the acceleration in the S/C body frame is computed for both linear and angular DoFs:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{a}_{x,B}(t) = P\:M^{-1}\delta(t-\tau) \hat{e},\label{eq:axB} \\
\vec{a}_{\theta}(t)= P\:\mathbf{I}^{-1}\delta(t-\tau)\left(\vec{r}\times\hat{e}\right), \label{eq:aq}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{a}_{x,B}$ is the acceleration of the spacecraft body frame in the linear DoFs, $\vec{a}_{\theta,B}$ is the acceleration of the spacecraft body frame in the angular DoFs, $P$ is the total transferred momentum, $\tau$ is the impact time, $\hat{e}$ is the unit-vector in the direction of the transferred momentum, $M$ is the mass of the S/C, $\mathbf{I}$ is the S/C moment of inertia about its center of mass, and $\vec{r}$ is the location of the impact relative to the center of mass. The angular accelerations at the TM locations are the same as described in (\ref{eq:aq}) but the linear accelerations pick up an additional terms due to the offset of the test mass from the center of mass:
\begin{equation}
\vec{a}_{x,TM}(t) = \vec{a}_{x,B} + \left(\vec{r}_{TM}\times \vec{a}_{\theta}\right),\label{eq:axTM}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{a}_{x,TM}$ is the acceleration in the linear DoFs as measured in the test mass frame and $\vec{r}_{TM}$ is the location of the test mass relative to the S/C center of mass.

Sensitivity to impacts is limited by two noise sources: noise in the measurement system and disturbances on the S/C.  Measurement noise for both the capacitive and interferometric systems is characterized by a white spectrum in displacement whereas the chief noise source for the S/C disturbance, the micropropulsion system itself, exhibits an approximately white spectrum in force.  The relative levels of these two components differ for each DoF, but the basic functional form for the noise power spectral density is:
\begin{equation}
S_{g}=S_0+S_4f^4,
\label{eq:noise}
\end{equation}
where $S_0$ is the amplitude of the S/C disturbance term and $S_4$ is the amplitude of the measurement term. The most substantial difference between the noise level in the various DoFs is in the amplitude of the $S_4$ term, which is substantially lower for the DoFs sensed by the interferometric system: $x,\,\eta,$ and $\phi$.  In \cite{Thorpe:2015cxa} it was shown that SNR of a simple impulse in the presence of this noise shape can be analytically computed as $\rho =  P_i/P_c$, where $P_i$ is the amplitude of the momentum transfer in that DoF and $P_c$ is a characteristic threshold momentum given by:
\begin{equation}
P_c \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(4 S_4 S_0^3\right)^{1/8}.\label{eq:SNRp}
\end{equation} 
The value of $P_c$ varies somewhat for each DoF due to the different combinations of sensing noise, micropropulsion noise, as well as differences in the spacecraft mass properties. The approximate range for linear DoFs is $0.05\,\mu\textrm{N-s}\leq P_c \leq 1\,\mu\textrm{N-s}$ and $0.3\,\mu\textrm{N-m-s}\leq P_c \leq 4\,\mu\textrm{N-m-s}$ for angular DoFs. This asymmetry in sensitivity along different DoFs means that impacts with lower overall momentum are often only detected in a fraction of DoF channels, meaning that the full set of parameters cannot be extracted. Similarly, impacts which happen to impart a large fraction of their momentum in a sensitive channel may be measured at lower thresholds than those coming from different directions.

\subsection{Detection and Parameter Estimation}\label{sec:MCMC}
\red{Describe the MCMC tool and what tests we did on it. }
%Data model
Assuming the frequency domain data $\data$ contains an impact signal $\model$ plus noise $\n$, and $\n$ is zero-mean Gaussian distributed, the likelihood for observing  $\data$ is
\begin{equation}
p(\data|\params) = \prod_f \frac{1}{\det \Cij} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} \residual_i \invCij \residual_j }
\label{eq:likelihood}
\end{equation}
where the $\residual = \data - \model(\params)$ is the residual, $\model(\params)$ is the modeled LISA Pathfinder response to an impact with parameters $\params$, and  $\Cij \equiv \langle \n_i \n_j\rangle$ is the one-sided noise correlation matrix. The indices $i$ and $j$ sum over different data channels, i.e. the 6 degrees of freedom $i:=(x,y,z,\theta,\eta,\phi)$ where $\theta$ is a rotation about $x$, $\eta$ is a rotation about $y$, and $\phi$ is a rotation about $z$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coordinates}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/dof.eps}
\caption{{\small Schematic showing the naming conventions for the six kinematic degrees of freedom used in this work.}}
\label{fig:coordinates}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The $x,y,z$ triad's origin is the center of the GRS housing with $\hat{z}$ in the sunward facing direction, $\hat{x}$ in the interferometric sensing direction (towards the other GRS) and $\hat{y}$ completing the triad.

%Noise model
We make the simplifying assumption that the noise correlation matrix $\Cij$ is diagonal, i.e. that the noise in each channel is independent.
We further assume that the noise in each channel is stationary, implying that there are no  correlations between different frequencies, and the noise is completely characterized by its variance 
\begin{equation}
\langle \n^2(f)\rangle \equiv \frac{T}{2}S_n(f)
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the duration of the data segment and $S_n(f)$ is the one-sided noise power spectral density.
For flexibility to fit realistic instrument noise, we use a phenomenological model for $S_n(f)$ rather than the theoretical form in Eq.~\ref{eq:noise}.
The model is adopted from the BayesLine algorithm~\citep{Littenberg_15} used for spectral estimation in analysis of transient sources detected by the ground-based gravitational wave detector network.
BayesLine is a trans-dimensional (or reversible jump) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm~\citep{Green_95}.
The spectral noise model is built from two-components:  the broad band spectral shape is fit with a cubic spline interpolation, where the number and location of spline control points are free parameters; and a linear combination of  Lorentzians to fit narrow band spectral lines. \red{Ira/Jake, say something about lines in the Pathfinder data?}.
The model is flexible, and proved to be well suited for fitting the LISA Pathfinder noise.

%Signal model
The signal model was implemented as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:sensitivity}, again using a trans dimensional MCMC.
The MCMC samples between hypothesis that the data contain only noise (i.e. that there is no impact signal in the model) or that the data contain noise and a single impact.
The ratio of MCMC iterations spent in the two hypothesis is the Bayes factor, or marginalized likelihood ratio, between the signal and the noise model.
We use the Bayes factor as the detection statistic, with a threshold of \red{XXX} for claiming a positive detection.
The Markov chain's samples from iterations which included the signal hypothesis are used to characterize the posterior distribution function of the impact parameters, conditional on a signal actually being present in the data.
Marginalized posterior distributions for the incident direction of the impact, and the momentum imparted to the spacecraft, are used to make further inferences about the micrometeorite population.
The priors for the signal parameters are uniform distributions in time, imparted momentum, impact location, and incident direction of the impact.  

%MCMC validation
Both the noise model and signal model MCMC samplers use parallel tempering to improve the convergence time of the chains.
The MCMC code went through a standard suite of tests to confirm that the results are accurate and robust.
The spectral estimation code is validating by testing that the whitened data $\data(f)/\sqrt{S_n(f)}$ are consistent with being drawn from a zero mean, unit variance, Gaussian.
We check detailed balance of the sampler by using a constant likelihood function and testing that the recovered distributions are consistent with the priors.
Finally, the samplers are tested for accuracy by analyzing simulated and real data with artificial signals added, verifying that the true signal parameters are included in the posterior distributions.
 
%Caveats
The noise and impact models used in this analysis are not perfect and further advancements may improve the detection efficiency and/or reduce systematic errors in parameter recovery.
A particular weakness is our assumption that the noise in each channel is independent. 
The sensing degrees of freedom are not the same as the kinematic degrees of freedom, so noise correlations are not necessarily negligible. 
We also found that, for large momentum impacts, a noticeable residual was left in the data, indicating that our signal model was not a perfect match to the data. 
This modeling mismatch results in an uncharacterized systematic error, though the macroscopic conclusions drawn from the posterior--which face of the spacecraft was impacted, from what (general) region of the sky did the impactor originate, and the overall distribution of imparted momenta of the impactors--are not expected to be biased to the point of misleading the general conclusions.
Improvements to the model, especially developing a physically motivated forward model of the instrument noise, are areas for future study.

\subsection{Post processing and vetos}\label{sec:vetos}
\red{Describe selection of candidates, application of vetos, and post-processing to do the sky angle conversion, sky area computation, etc.}
For each segment of data, the MCMC tool described in Section \ref{sec:MCMC} was run for in an initial search comprised of XXX steps on the TM1 data. After discarding the first XXX steps of the chain as ``burn in'' samples, the detection fraction was computed as the ratio of chain steps where an impact model was included to the total number of steps.  For systems with a detection fraction above XXX, the MCMC tool was re-run in a characterization step of XXX steps on both TM1 and TM2. A burn-in period of XXX steps was discarded from both chains and the detection fraction was again computed as well as the variance in the impact time parameter $\tau$.  For systems with an above-threshold detection fraction and impact time variance of less than XXX in both TMs were passed on to the next step in the vetting process, manual inspection.  For the manual inspection process, an expanded set of telemetry from the spacecraft around the candidate impact time was downloaded and inspected.  Examples of signals inspected include all force and torque signals, all position and attitude signals, selected voltage levels, and internal telemetry of the micropropulsion system. This process yielded two types of false triggers: thruster current spikes and data gaps. Candidates for which the signals appeared consistent with expectations were added to the catalog.

For vetted impact candidates, an additional post-processing step was conducted to extract parameters of interest.  In order to compare with the micrometeoroid population models in Section \ref{sec:models}, it was necessary to transform the impact direction from S/C coordinates to the \red{frame name?} used by the models.  This transformation was done in two steps, first from the S/C frame to an Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame using the S/C quaternion telemetry provided by the star tracker, and then from ECI to the \red{frame name} using the S/C ephemeris. Median sky location and a 90\% confidence sky area for both frames was computed using HEALPIX.\red{cite something}.

\FloatBarrier
\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
In this paper we restrict our analysis to segments of data where no signals were deliberately injected into the LPF system. We identified a total of \nhours hours of data in three distinct configurations: the nominal LPF configuration in which the European-provided DFACS control system and cold gas micropropulsion system were operating (2957 hours), the DRS configuration in which the NASA-provided DCS control system and colloidal micropropulsion system were operating (1207 hours), and a hybrid configuration in which the DFACS was controlling the S/C using the colloidals (184 hours). Figure \ref{fig:timeline} shows a timeline of these segments along with the detected impacts plotted with their total transferred momentum along the vertical axis. The total number of detected impacts is 54: 36 in the nominal configuration, 15 in the DRS configuration, and 3 in the hybrid configuration. This corresponds to a rough event rate of 0.3 impacts/day, which is broadly consistent with the estimate made in \cite{Thorpe:2015cxa}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\caption{Timeline of impact events during LPF. The yellow dots show the impact times with the total transferred momentum defining the vertical axis.

In the following sections we present some example events in detail and summarize some properties of the observed population.  A full catalog of the impacts and their estimated parameters can be found in Appendix A.

\subsection{Sample candidate events \label{sec:samples}}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:sensitivity}, LPF's sensitivity depends on the parameters of the impact including both the total momentum transferred as well as the fraction of that momentum that is  projected into each DoF.  As a result, the quality of our parameter estimation varies greatly from impact to impact.  Figure \ref{fig:goodExample} shows results for an impact occurring at GPS time $t_{gps}=1154024345.4$, corresponding to 2016-07-31 18:18:48.400 UTC. With a moderately high transferred momentum of $8.5\,\mu\textrm{N-s}$ and a S/C longitude that aligns well with the sensitive x-axis, the total SNR in the two TMs are $\rho_1\approx16$ and $\rho_2\approx?$ . Figure \ref{fig:goodExample}(a) shows an overlaid corner plot representing the posterior probabilities for the impact parameters as measured by TM1 (in red, lower-left) and TM2 (in blue, upper-right).  The panels are arranged in a grid with rows and columns corresponding to the following parameters: total transferred momentum ($P_{tot}$, in $\mu$N-s), S/C latitude defined relative to the S/C x-y plane ($lat$, in deg.), S/C longitude defined relative to the +x axis ($lon$, in deg.), and x,y,z, locations of the impact with respect to the S/C center of mass ($r_x,\,r_y,\,r_z$ in $m$). \red{are the locations with respect to mechanical frame or body frame?}. The panels along the diagonal show the posterior probability density for each parameter as measured by TM1 (red) and TM2 (blue).  The panels on the off-diagonals show the correlation between pairs of parameters in the TM1 data (lower off-diagonals) and TM2 data (upper off-diagonals). The measured parameters between these two impacts are broadly consistent, although TM1 generally prefers a solution with slightly increased $P_{tot}$, larger $lat$, and positive shifts in both $r_x$ and $r_z$. The variances in the parameters for TM1 are also slightly smaller than for TM2, likely as a result of increased signal in TM1.\red{we should check, I think we have SNR data for both}.

Figure \ref{fig:goodExample}(b) shows the reconstructed sky localization in the \red{frame name} frame using the TM1 data.  The 90\% confidence interval \red{(check)} encompasses an area of 3860$\,\textrm{deg}^2$. and is centered at a latitude of -43 deg and a longitude of -91 deg, meaning that the impactor originated from the direction of LPF's orbit and from below the ecliptic. Figure \ref{fig:goodExample}(c) shows the reconstructed S/C impact location on a map of the LPF exterior that has been flattened to show the full surface. \red{we need some labels on these figures to make these easier to understand}.  The most likely location of impact is on the +y vertical panel about 2/3 of the way up towards the top deck. \red{we should check the table program because the table shows +x+y}.

Figure \ref{fig:Example} shows a similar set of plots as Figure \ref{fig:goodExample} but for an impact occurring at $t_{gps} = 1149475987.7$ (2016-06-09 02:52:50.700 UTC) which had a lower total momentum ($P_{tot}\approx1.0\,\mu\textrm{N-s}$), and lower SNR ($\rho_1\approx1.5$, $\rho_2\approx?$). As a result, the constraints on parameters other than the total momentum are rather weak.  The impact location is favored towards the -x and +z faces and the preferred direction to the impactor is in the forward direction (latitudes around -90 deg) and above the ecliptic.

\subsection{Ensemble results}
Before comparing our observations with the detailed models of the dust complex described section \ref{sec:models}, it is useful to examine some basic properties of the observed ensemble. Figure \ref{fig:CDF_P} shows the cumulative momentum distribution of the observed events, with the median momentum indicated by the yellow diamond \red{marker} and the \red{XXX} confidence interval indicated by the horizontal bars.  As is generally expected from all models of the dust complex, the number of impacts falls with the total momentum. Two single-index power-law fits to the data, both inlcuding and excluding the highest-momentum impact, are plotted in the red and purple lines, and have power-law indices of -0.73 and -0.97 respectively. \red{check numbers and get error bars}. Also plotted for reference are the predicted flux averaged over the four models described in section \ref{sec:models} and a fit to them with a power law index of \red{XXX}. \red{What else do we want to say here? Do we want to try fitting various breaks, etc.  Is there a nice Bayesian way to do that?}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Cumulative momentum distribution of observed impacts. We should divide by the number of impacts to get this in a fractional sense. \label{fig:CDF_P}}
\end{figure}

A second property of the observed distribution is the time of arrival statistics, which are expected to be governed by a Poisson process. Figure \ref{fig:CDF_rate} shows the cumulative probability density of the observed time between events, which was computed by excising the times not included in our data set. As is expected for a Poisson process, this distribution follows an exponential function, with a time between events of $2.94\pm0.05\,$days.

\section{Population Model Inference} \label{sec:model_inference}

Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis we can piggyback on our Bayesian treatment of impacts to make interences about the populations producing those impacts. The hierarchical analysis begins by considering a broader model including both the population and impact processes, which we may jointly parameterize by $\theta=\{\theta_P,\theta_I\}$, combining ``population'' parameters and ``impact'' parameters, respectively.  For the joint model, Bayes theorem looks like
\begin{equation}
  p(\theta_I,\theta_P|D)=\frac{p(D|\theta_I,\theta_P)p(\theta_I|\theta_P)p(\theta_P)}{p(D)}.
\end{equation}
where $D=\{D_\alpha\}$ is the combined full set of LPF data segments considered here, and $\theta_I$ is abstractly encompasses impact parameters across the full data set.

Here we primarily interested in $\theta_P$, describing the population models, as in Sec.~\ref{sec:models}, so we marginalize over $\theta_I$.  This provides a Baysian framework for population inference
\begin{eqnarray}
  p(\theta_P|D)&=&\frac{ p(D|\theta_P)p(\theta_P)}{p(D)}\label{eq:HierBayesThm}\\
  p(D|\theta_P)&=&\int p(D|\theta_I)p(\theta_I|\theta_P)d\theta_I\label{eq:metaLike}.
\end{eqnarray}
The last line expresses the effective likelihood function that we need for the population model inference analysis assuming that micrometeoriod impacts likelihoods depend only on the nature of the impacts $\theta_I$ and not also \textit{explicitly} on other features of the population $\theta_P$.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Micrometeoroids are important and we want to know more
\item We used an entirely novel method to sample the micrometeoroid population at L1
\item We are consistent (or not) with models and we have some idea as to why (or why not)
\item Some rough statements about what this means for LISA  and also other missions (telescopes)
\end{itemize}

%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their 
%% telescopes the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope 
%% facilities.
%
%% Following the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} or \facilities{} macros to list the keywords of facilities used 
%% in the research for the paper.  Each keyword is check against the master 
%% list during copy editing.  Individual instruments can be provided in 
%% parentheses, after the keyword, but they are not verified.

\vspace{5mm}
\facilities{LPF (\url{http://sci.esa.int/lisa-pathfinder/})}

%% Similar to \facility{}, there is the optional \software command to allow 
%% authors a place to specify which programs were used during the creation of 
%% the manusscript. Authors should list each code and include either a
%% citation or url to the code inside ()s when available.

\software{LTPDA (\url{https://www.elisascience.org/ltpda/})}

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc. The
%% Figure and Table counter will not reset


 \appendix
 \section{List of Impact Events in LPF}
\input{latex_table.tex}


%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% \aastex provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.

\bibliography{Bibliography2}

%% This command is needed to show the entire author+affilation list when
%% the collaboration and author truncation commands are used.  It has to
%% go at the end of the manuscript.

%% Include this line if you are using the \added, \replaced, \deleted
